# Real-time-object-detection-with-deep-learning-and-OpenCV
This project is implementation of Real time Object detection in video with deep learning and OpenCV

To build our deep learning-based real-time object detector with OpenCV weâ€™ll need to 
(1) access our webcam/video stream in an efficient manner and 
(2) apply object detection to each frame.

To see our real-time deep-learning based object detector in action, execute the following command,
