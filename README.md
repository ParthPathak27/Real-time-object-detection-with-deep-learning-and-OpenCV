# Real-time-object-detection-with-deep-learning-and-OpenCV
This project is the implementation of Real-time Object detection in video with deep learning and OpenCV.

To build our deep learning-based real-time object detector with OpenCV weâ€™ll need to (1) access our webcam/video stream in an efficient manner and (2) apply object detection to each frame.
